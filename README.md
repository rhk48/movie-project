This project analyzes a series of data sets to provide insights and recommendations for Microsoft's ability to become profitable in their recent venture of creating their own film industry. Descriptive analysis of the data shows that the months with the highest movie releases tend to have lowest Return On Investments(RIO), days with the highest releases tend to have lower RIOs, and that 11 film studios have the highest domestic growth by a long shot compared to all other film studios in North America. Microsoft can use this analysis to further their goal of becoming a profitable film studio. My main sources were The-Numbers.com, The Movie Database, and Box Office Mojo.

# Business Understanding
Microsoft can increase their profitability if they: A) Release films in during months that have the lowest number of releases, B) Release films primarily on Fridays, in addition to other days that show a high RIO when released on given day, and C) Look into partnering with a highly profitable film studio or invest market research in the studios that have shown the highest domestic gross on films.   
# Data Analysis & Methodology
This project focuses on descriptive analysis, in addition to looking at trends that build onto one another. It will provide Microsoft with the proper recommendations and insight to further its goals of being a profitable studio.  
# Results
Most months that show a high number of releases also show a lower RIO compared to months that have a low number of releases have a higher RIO.

Friday has the highest number of film releases, and the highest RIO, but all days that follow have a correlation of high number of releases and low RIO and a low number of releases with a high RIO.

# Conclusion & Future Steps 
- The mains months that Microsoft Studios should release their films based on ROI follow in this respective order: March, September, July, May, August, February, October, November, December, January, June, and April

- The mains months that Microsoft Studios should release their films based on ROI follow in this respective order: Friday, Wednesday, Thursday, Tuesday, Sunday, Saturday, and Monday

- Microsoft Studios should partner with a studio that has shown high level of profitability. If they donâ€™t partner with any studio, they should at least put focus their main market research on the studios with the highest RIOs to have greater profitability in the future.
