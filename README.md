This project analyzes a series of data sets to provide insights and recommendations for Microsoft's ability to become profitable in their recent venture of creating their own film industry. Descriptive analysis of the data shows that the months with the highest movie releases tend to have lowest Return On Investments(RIO), days with the highest releases tend to have lower RIOs, and that 11 film studios have the highest domestic growth by a long shot compared to all other film studios in North America. Microsoft can use this analysis to further their goal of becoming a profitable film studio. 

# Business Understanding
Microsoft can increase their profitability if they: A) Release films in during months that have the lowest number of releases, B) Release films primarily on Fridays, in addition to other days that show a high RIO when released on given day, and C) Look into partnering with a highly profitable film studio or invest market research in the studios that have shown the highest domestic gross on films.
